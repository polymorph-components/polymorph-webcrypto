//! The archived-corpus containers the `rkyv-corpus` measurement feature
//! embeds, written by build.rs and accessed zero-copy by `plan`. Shared
//! between the build script (which `#[path]`-includes this file) and the
//! crate, so the serialized and accessed types cannot drift.

/// One generator row's corpus, with everything registration needs
/// precomputed natively by build.rs:
///
/// - Names come pre-split per the `CaseName` canonical rule (prefix =
///   everything before the last slash, leaf = final segment) and
///   pre-concatenated: `prefixes_blob`/`leaves_blob` are the row's case
///   prefixes/leaves back to back, `prefix_ranges`/`leaf_ranges` the
///   per-case `(start, end)` byte ranges into them. At registry build
///   the guest turns each blob into one shared `ArcStr` and every
///   case's `CaseName` is two refcounted substrings — no per-case
///   string allocation, no runtime prefix filtering or stripping.
/// - `cases[i]` is the archived case body input, deserialized only when
///   the case runs.
/// - `features` is the row's uniform feature set as an index into
///   [`FEATURE_SETS`] (rows are uniformly tagged — asserted by build.rs
///   here and by the census-parity test natively).
///
/// One blob per vector-backed row (contract rows are table-driven, not
/// corpus-backed) means shared corpora (aead, hmac, ...) are split
/// natively at build time instead of being rebuilt and filtered once
/// per row at registry build.
