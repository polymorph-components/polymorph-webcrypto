# Run cargo-mutants over the shared crypto core and the Wasmtime host, with
# the unit tests plus both conformance suites (via the ct driver's
# env-gated oracle test) as the oracle: a mutant survives only if neither
# distinguishes it. This is what polices assertion *strength* — the
# lockfiles pin the case inventory, not what the cases check. Expensive and
# deliberately NOT part of `just ci`; a weekly job runs it (the timing-lab
# workflow). Needs cargo-mutants (`cargo install cargo-mutants --locked`).
# Guests are prebuilt from unmutated sources: the subject is the host stack
# the wasm calls into. Results land in mutants.out/.
#
# Two mutants run at a time, each in its own copy of the tree (the oracle
# suites run single-threaded, so the test phases parallelize cleanly, and
# cargo-mutants' shared jobserver keeps the build phases from
# oversubscribing the runner). The guest paths are absolute for the same
# reason: the copies must reach the one prebuilt pair.
#
# The verdict is the missed set, not cargo-mutants' exit code: exit 3
# ("some mutants timed out") is a pass when mutants.out/missed.txt is
# empty, because on this host a hang IS a distinction — the WIT drain
# contract makes an operation that returns without draining its input
# stream deadlock the guest's feeder. Every other nonzero status (missed
# mutants, usage error, failing baseline) stays fatal.
