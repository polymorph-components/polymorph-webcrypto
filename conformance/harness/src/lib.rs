//! The parts of the conformance guests that do not depend on which world a
//! guest is built against.
//!
//! There are two guests because there must be: the signing guest imports
//! `ecdsa-sign`, which the in-guest provider deliberately never exports, so
//! a single component could not run under every target. That split is a
//! property of their *worlds*, and everything below is unaffected by it —
//! the probe table, how a case is named, which feature names exist, how a
//! WIT error is rendered, how an expected failure is asserted, how bytes
//! are delivered to an operation ([`stream`]), and how a target's
//! missing-feature declaration is validated.
//!
//! Keeping those here means the two guests cannot answer the same question
//! differently. Error rendering is the one that would bite first: a failure
//! message is a suite's whole diagnostic output, and two renderers drifting
//! apart makes the same underlying failure look like two different ones
//! depending on which suite reported it.
//!
//! What deliberately stays in each guest is the harness that materializes
//! cases, because it is typed against `wit_bindgen`-generated types that
//! differ per world.
