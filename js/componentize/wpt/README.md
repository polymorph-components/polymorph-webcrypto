# WPT harness for the webcrypto-componentize library

Runs the [web-platform-tests] WebCryptoAPI suites covering this library's
surface against `js/componentize/webcrypto.js` inside a componentize-js
guest, composed with the in-guest `polymorph-webcrypto-guest-provider` provider — the same
pipeline as `examples/componentize-demo`. Run it from the repository root
with:

```sh
just wpt::test
```

This check gates in CI, and nobody — CI or contributor — builds the
componentize-js toolchain, which compiles SpiderMonkey to wasm. The two
artifacts involved have very different costs, and are handled accordingly:

- The **runner component** takes about five seconds to componentize, so
  [`component.sh build`](component.sh) builds it from the working tree on
  every run. There is no published runner and no input lock: the check
  always exercises the tree under test, and a stale artifact is not
  representable. The in-guest provider and driver it is composed with are
  likewise built fresh, so `polymorph-webcrypto-core`/`polymorph-webcrypto-guest-provider` changes are always
  exercised.
- The **toolchain** takes about twenty minutes, and depends on nothing but
  the revision in [`../componentize-js.rev`](../componentize-js.rev). The
  [`componentize-js-toolchain`](../../../.github/workflows/componentize-js-toolchain.yml)
  workflow builds one per (revision, platform), publishes it on the rolling
  [`toolchains` release] with a build-provenance attestation, and
  `component.sh` downloads it into `target/toolchains/` on first use.

  That binary is the compiler for the component under test, so it is pinned
  by digest, not by filename: `component.sh` verifies the download and every
  later use of the cached copy against
  [`../componentize-js.sha256`](../componentize-js.sha256) and refuses to
  execute anything else. Recording a digest is a separate, manual step
  (`just componentize::update-toolchain-digest`), which verifies the attestation — subject
  digest, repository, and workflow — before writing it. So trusting a new
  toolchain is a reviewable diff, and published assets are immutable (the
  workflow uploads without `--clobber`) so a recorded digest cannot be
  invalidated underneath you.

Pushing a change to the pin triggers that workflow. Until it publishes — and
until its digests are recorded — this check fails with instructions rather
than compiling SpiderMonkey or executing an unverified binary; re-run it once
the toolchain is available and pinned. To test against a
componentize-js you built yourself, point `COMPONENTIZE_JS` at it (see
[../README.md](../README.md)).

## What the gate asserts

Every in-subset test must pass. Beyond that, the observed census — per group,
how many tests land in each of the four buckets — must match
[`expected.js`](expected.js) exactly.

Counting is not asserting. Subset membership is decided by matching WPT test
*names*, so without the census an upstream rename in a re-vendored file could
move a test from "must pass" to "expected to fail" with no signal, and a
suite that registered nothing at all would report `0/0 in-subset tests
passed` and gate green having tested nothing. Pinning all four buckets turns
each of those into a failure with a diff — including an out-of-subset test
that starts *passing*, which is the sign the subset definition has drifted
from what the library actually serves.

This is the WPT path's equivalent of `conformance/*/tests.lock`. Regenerate
it with `just wpt::update-expectations` when a change legitimately moves a
number, and review the diff.

The out-of-subset buckets are a to-do list, not a boundary: WPT coverage is
a first-class design constraint (see AGENTS.md, "WPT fidelity is a
first-class design constraint"), and the census is the meter of how much of
`crypto.subtle`'s observable behavior survives the WIT shape. Growing the
package surface includes vendoring the WPT groups that observe it; a test
no shim could ever move in-subset marks a WIT-forced deviation, which
belongs in the shim header's classified deviations list.

## The parity gate (jco path)

`just wpt::parity` measures those losses instead of asserting counts. The
same vendored suites run twice, ending at the same platform crypto, with
only the carrier stack differing:

```
baseline:    WPT tests ─────────────────────────────────► platform crypto.subtle
round trip:  WPT tests ► shim ► WIT ► component ABI ► jco ► platform crypto.subtle
```

`parity/baseline.mjs` runs the suite bundles directly on this Node's
`crypto.subtle`; `parity-runner.js` (componentized from the tree against
the `wpt-parity-runner` world in [`wit/`](wit/), ungated — it reports
every result and asserts nothing in-guest) is transpiled by jco against
`js/jco/webcrypto.js` and run by `parity/roundtrip.mjs`. The runner
streams each record through its `wpt:parity/reporter` import as the test
settles — the Node leg just collects them; the browser page shows them
live — and `run` resolves to a record count the embedder cross-checks.
Because both legs end at the identical platform
engine, the platform's own coverage cancels out: whatever it does not
implement fails both legs, with no exclusion list to maintain. Every test
the baseline passes and the round trip does not is a *loss* introduced by
the stack in the middle, and `parity/compare.mjs` holds the loss set to
[`parity/losses.js`](parity/losses.js) — a ratchet, maintained like
`expected.js`: a loss not recorded there fails the run (a regression), a
recorded loss no longer observed fails it too (progress must land as a
reviewable diff, via `just wpt::update-losses`). Which *kind* each loss is —
unserved or WIT-forced — is the shim header's deviations registry's to say.
Two properties of the comparison follow from how WPT registers tests. Test
names are outcome-dependent — a failed setup step registers a synthetic
step name in place of the real test's — so round-trip-only *failures* are
expected renames, while a round-trip-only *pass* fails the run: a pass the
baseline never measured is outside the gate's premise. Both legs run the
shared group table in [`groups.js`](groups.js), and the comparator fails
hard if their observed group sets diverge anyway. And the baseline is
recomputed per run, never pinned, so a platform upgrade moves both legs
together; the loss set is sensitive to the platform only where the
platform itself is.

### The browser legs (Firefox, Chromium, WebKit)

`just wpt::parity-firefox` and `just wpt::parity-chromium` run the same two
legs in a headless browser — Playwright's pinned builds (Firefox launched
with Gecko's JSPI pref; Chromium ships JSPI), driven by
`parity/run-browser.mjs` over the same legs module the parity page uses
(web/legs.mjs) — and hold each round trip to that engine's own ratchet:
[`parity/losses-firefox.js`](parity/losses-firefox.js) and
[`parity/losses-chromium.js`](parity/losses-chromium.js), maintained via
`just wpt::update-losses-firefox` / `-chromium`. A loss set is a fact
about one engine's baseline, so each engine ratchets separately: the
engines pass different platform surfaces (AES-192 and P-521 exist on
Firefox and Node but not Chromium; buffer-copy timing differs on all
three), and the same package ruling can surface as a loss on one engine
and a divergent pass on another (the Ed25519 strict small-order
rejection does exactly that). An engine only moves when the pinned
playwright-core version does, so the ratchets move in reviewable diffs.
Both gate in CI (the jco job); local runs opt in with
`WPT_PARITY_FIREFOX=1` / `WPT_PARITY_CHROMIUM=1` after
`cd parity && npx playwright-core install --with-deps firefox chromium`.

`just wpt::parity-webkit` is the same gate for WebKit, with two venue
constraints. Its ratchet ([`parity/losses-webkit.js`](parity/losses-webkit.js),
via `just wpt::update-losses-webkit`) is recorded from Playwright's WebKit
on *macOS*, where WebCore sits on Apple's crypto backend — the closest
available proxy for mobile Safari, and the point of the leg; the Linux
port's libgcrypt backend serves less (no Ed25519/X25519) and its
WebContent process crashes under this workload, so it can neither gate
nor record. And no componentize-js toolchain is published for darwin, so
the CI gate is a two-job handoff: ubuntu builds the page artifacts
(`just wpt::web-artifacts`), the macOS job downloads them and runs the
leg. WebKit's baseline is the strongest of the gated engines
(JavaScriptCore ships JSPI; Apple's backend serves Ed25519, X25519,
P-521, and AES-192).

The venue constraints make the WebKit ratchet the only one a Linux
machine cannot re-record by running the leg, so it has two mac-free
paths, both riding CI's macOS runner as the recording engine:

- **Re-record from CI's records.** The macOS job uploads the
  comparator's two inputs as the `wpt-parity-webkit-records` artifact on
  every run, pass or fail; `just gha::update-webkit-losses-from-ci`
  downloads the branch's latest and runs the update comparison locally.
  On a gate failure the job also writes the proposed `losses-webkit.js`
  diff to its step summary and uploads the rewritten file
  (`wpt-parity-webkit-proposed-ratchet`), so the re-record can be a
  review-and-commit with no local tooling.
- **Predict from the Chromium delta.** A shim change's loss-set movement
  is usually engine-generic (decided in the shim/WIT layers before the
  engine's crypto is reached), so `just wpt::predict-losses-webkit`
  applies the branch's `losses-chromium.js` delta to the WebKit ratchet
  as set operations — often landing the re-record before any CI run.
  The guess is safe because the gate is two-sided (unlisted losses fail,
  and so do listed losses not observed): a wrong prediction cannot pass,
  it fails CI like any stale ratchet and falls back to the record path
  above, and a green run verifies a predicted file exactly as it would a
  recorded one. Predictions miss where the engines genuinely diverge —
  a delta addition for a test WebKit's baseline fails natively, or names
  the two engines' records render differently.

## The browser parity page (web/)

`web/` is the same two legs run live in a visiting browser, published on
the GitHub Pages site: the baseline against that browser's own
`crypto.subtle`, the round trip through a web transpile of the same parity
runner (`transpile:web` in parity/package.json — every import mapped to a
relative path, wasi included, so the module loads in the page's Web
Worker with no import map; `just wpt::web-artifacts` vendors the
preview2-shim browser build those paths resolve to). Both legs run in the
worker and stream: the round trip's records arrive through the runner's
reporter import as each test settles, so the page shows live progress
mid-run; a main-thread fallback runs the same legs if the worker path
fails. The round trip needs JSPI; without it the page runs the baseline
alone. Nothing on the page gates, and the pinned ratchets do not apply to
it: loss sets are recorded from pinned engines (`losses.js` from Node,
`losses-firefox.js`, `losses-chromium.js`, and `losses-webkit.js` from
Playwright's builds), and a visiting browser's baseline legitimately
differs. Serve it locally with `just wpt::web`.

Like the conformance viewer, the page's serving tree must mirror the
repository layout: the transpiled runner imports `js/jco/webcrypto.js` by
relative path.

The `.https.any.js` drivers are kept for reference; the runner invokes the
suites' entry points directly with this library's algorithms (`HMAC`,
`AES-GCM`, `X25519`), exactly as those drivers do among others. Each
group's subset follows what the library serves (`groups.js`'s classifiers
are the authoritative definition): most groups assert their served slices
whole, the KDF groups exclude their SHA-1 and unserved-target rows, and
`sign_verify/ecdsa` stays empty-subset — every test in it needs ECDSA
signing or a generated pair, which is class D and unserved by composition
(see the shim header's deviations list), so it meters that gap. The
`sign_verify/rsa_pss` and `sign_verify/rsa_pkcs` groups stay empty-subset
too: every subtest's fixture import includes the vector's private pkcs8
half, and the package's RSA signature surface is verification-only, so they meter
the unserved private side. `encrypt_decrypt/rsa_oaep` stays empty-subset
for the composition's reason: every subtest imports both halves of an
RSA-OAEP pair, and the in-guest provider withholds both minting
interfaces (decryption is class D; OAEP encryption has no secret-free
half — see the shim header's deviations list), so the group meters the
unserved family.

## How it runs

WPT test files are classic scripts sharing globals, and the componentize-js
guest world is ES modules, so `component.sh` concatenates each suite
(helpers + vectors + test script) into a module under `build/` with an
appended `export` of its entry point — the vendored sources stay pristine.
`harness.js` supplies the small `testharness.js` surface those files use
(`promise_test` and the `assert_*` family, run sequentially), and
`runner.js` installs the library as the `crypto`/`CryptoKey` globals, drives
the suites, and classifies every result by test name:

- **in-subset** — parameters the library documents as served. These must
  all pass; any failure fails the run.
- **out-of-subset** — the rest of WPT's parameter sweep (other hashes and
  AES key sizes, and so on). These are expected to fail with the library's
  documented fail-closed errors and are reported by count.

The classifier functions in `groups.js` are the precise, machine-readable
definition of the subset; the suite gates that every in-subset test passes
and surfaces any out-of-subset test that unexpectedly passes (the counts are
printed either way).
