# Conformance tests

Two test **suites** — the shared suite ([`guest-ct/`](guest-ct)) and the
host-only signing suite ([`signing-guest-ct/`](signing-guest-ct)), each a
guest component carrying its cases — run against every implementation of
`polymorph:webcrypto` on the [`polymorph:test`] stack: the suites are built
on its guest SDK and export its frozen `tests` contract, and the drivers,
lockfiles, and aggregation are its tooling. Run everything with
`just conformance-ct::all` (see [`driver-ct/justfile`](driver-ct/justfile)
for the individual recipes and the currently enabled targets).

## Cases, feature tags, and the lockfiles

Expectation policy lives in the cases, not the harness. Each case carries a
stable name (`<algorithm>/<source>/<case>/<schedule>` for vector cases,
`probe/<name>` for API-contract probes) and the feature **tags** it
exercises beyond the baseline surface. A target declares only the features
it is **missing** ([`driver-ct/targets.toml`](driver-ct/targets.toml)):
scheduling against that manifest is the runner's business — cases never
inspect feature state — and each feature's decline assertion is its own
`!feature` case, scheduled exactly on targets missing it. Growing the
suites therefore never silently sheds coverage: new cases run everywhere
until a target consciously opts out.

Each suite's case inventory is pinned by a component-test lockfile
(`guest-ct/tests.lock`, `signing-guest-ct/tests.lock`); the inventory is
the binding — the recorded sha256 is build provenance only, since wasm
builds are not reproducible across checkouts (polymorph-components/polymorph-test#44).
The lockfiles enumerate every case: exact `[[case]]` entries for probes
and declines, and per-leaf `cases` enumerations for the `[[generated]]`
rows (`lock --leaves`, fed from `ct-driver --enumerate` — a vector case
appearing, vanishing, or being substituted lands as a named diff line,
and the aggregate's coverage check holds every target to the same set).
`just conformance-ct::lock-check` gates drift and
`just conformance-ct::lock-update` regenerates after intentional case
changes, landing them as a reviewable diff. The aggregates bind against
these same committed lockfiles. The census-parity tests
(`census_test.rs` in each suite crate) additionally anchor the inventory to
the retired incumbent harness's final census, frozen at the M1.6
cutover (and re-frozen as the incumbent's suites grew before its
retirement landed) as `src/census-fixture.lock` in each suite crate. The
port diverges from the incumbent ids in exactly one documented way, which
the parity tests account for: the additive `!feature` decline cases
(above). All other ids — including the RSA algorithm segments' modulus
words (`rsassa-pkcs1-v15-sha256-2048` etc.) — match the incumbent's
verbatim under the amended component-model label grammar (number-only
kebab words after the first).

The lockfiles pin the **inventory**, not the assertions. A case that keeps
its name while weakening what it checks produces no lockfile diff; that is
caught by review, and measured empirically by the weekly mutation run
(`just mutants`) — a mutant of the crypto core or the Wasmtime host that
neither the unit tests nor these suites distinguish fails that job.

Every executed vector runs under multiple **chunking schedules** (`whole`,
1-byte `bytes`, block-boundary `straddle`; empty stream inputs collapse to
`whole`). The streams-only WIT makes delivery schedule observable to
implementations, so chunking invariance is part of the conformance claim —
a class of test a buffer-based API could not even express.

## Targets and aggregation

`just conformance-ct::all` builds the suites and the driver, drift-checks
the lockfiles, runs the targets, and aggregates:

- **wasmtime-rustcrypto** (`run-wasmtime`): ct-driver embeds
  `polymorph-webcrypto-wasmtime` with every gated interface enabled — the
  full-support target.
- **composed** (`run-composed`): the suite plugged with the in-guest
  RustCrypto provider (`wac plug`), run under the generic component-test
  host runner; missing only the structural `ecdsa-sign` (class D).
- **jco-node** (`run-jco`): the suite transpiled with jco (JSPI) and driven
  from Node 24+ against `webcrypto-jco`; missing `sha1-checked` (platform
  SHA-1 carries no sha1dc collision detection).
- **jco-browser** (`run-browser`): the same transpiles and host module with
  the case loop running in headless Chromium, driven by
  `driver-ct/jco/run-browser.mjs` over the upstream page driver; missing
  `sha1-checked` and, for the signing suite, the fail-closed RSA
  private-key mints (`rsa-sign`, `rsa-oaep-decrypt`). Optional: it gates
  in CI (the runner image ships Chrome) and runs locally only with
  `CONFORMANCE_BROWSER=1`; the aggregates warn, not error, when its
  results are absent.
- **jco-firefox** (`run-firefox`): the same driver in Playwright's pinned
  Firefox (the upstream driver applies Gecko's JSPI pref); the same
  missing features as jco-browser, plus an expected-fail ledger for the
  Gecko/NSS strictness windows (#356). Runs as the dedicated
  conformance-firefox CI job — Firefox paces the suites several times
  slower than Chromium, so the leg gets a runner to itself, with the
  transpiled suites handed over from the conformance job; locally
  `CONFORMANCE_FIREFOX=1` after a one-time
  `npx playwright-core install --with-deps firefox` in `driver-ct/jco`.
- **jco-webkit** (`run-webkit`): the same driver in Playwright WebKit on
  macOS — Apple's crypto backend, the Safari proxy; the driver refuses
  other platforms, where WebKit's backend represents no shipping Safari.
  Runs as the dedicated macOS CI job (the transpiles are built on ubuntu
  and handed over); results reach local checkouts via the CI artifact
  flow.
- **deltic-deno** (`run-deltic`): the same reference host rewritten over
  deltic's embedder API, runtime-linked under stock Deno — no transpile;
  missing `sha1-checked` and `rsa-verify-8192`, with an expected-fail
  ledger for the Deno platform windows (#351).
- The **signing suite** runs under the host-backed targets
  (wasmtime-rustcrypto, jco-node, the browser-engine targets, and
  deltic-deno) only: its world imports
  `ecdsa-sign` structurally, which class D keeps out of the
  in-guest provider (see `rust/guest-provider/README.md`). The
  negative-composition gate (`just conformance-ct::class-d`, part of
  `all`) holds that declaration to the truth: it asserts the signing suite
  does not compose with the in-guest provider, so the provider cannot
  start exporting `ecdsa-sign` while the manifest still says it does not.
  The same gate asserts every other withheld minting interface with a
  dedicated minimal probe world (`class-d/*/wit`, one per interface): the
  signing suite's composition already fails on `ecdsa-sign`, so only a
  component importing *nothing withheld but* interface X can prove X
  stays unserved.

Each target writes JSONL results (`driver-ct/results/`), plus a small
`<target>.meta.json` provenance sidecar (engine + version) where the
runner knows them; the aggregation
step (`component-test aggregate`) validates every results file against the
lockfile and the target manifest and renders
[`driver-ct/matrix.md`](driver-ct/matrix.md) /
[`matrix-signing.md`](driver-ct/matrix-signing.md), exiting nonzero on any
failure or transport problem. In CI the jco-webkit leg runs on a macOS
job, so the gating aggregation — the committed-matrix check and the
compat gates — happens in the `conformance-aggregate` job once every
target's results have been merged.

## The compat matrix

[`driver-ct/compat/`](driver-ct/compat) generates an MDN-style support
matrix from the same results: rows are algorithms grouped by the owning
WIT interface, columns are the targets, and subrows appear exactly where
targets diverge within an algorithm. `driver-ct/compat/README.md` is the
specification (registry schema, fail-closed validation, cell semantics);
`just conformance-ct::compat-data` builds `results/compat.json` and the
page at `driver-ct/compat/index.html` renders it — locally over
`just conformance-ct::web`, published on the Pages site with the latest
main CI run's results.

`just conformance-ct::web` serves the results viewer — component-test's
`js/viewer`, staged at the pinned rev by `_viewer-prepared` with this
repository's data wiring (`driver-ct/jco/stage-viewer.mjs`) — over the
repository root: the matrix pane aggregates the last run's
`driver-ct/results/` with the gate's own aggregation code compiled to
wasm, and the live pane runs the transpiled suites in the browser. The
Pages site publishes the same viewer with the latest main CI run's
results staged from the `conformance-results` artifact.

## Vector provenance

What review cannot establish on its own is whether a vendored vector is
what upstream published. [`vectors/README.md`](vectors/README.md) records
the upstream revision of every file for that purpose, so a copy can be
re-fetched and diffed against its source.

## Growing the suites

Adding an algorithm interface to the package is not done until its vector
cases are here: vendor the vectors, extend the translation policy in
`vectors/README.md` + `guest-ct/src/translate.rs` (they must agree), wire
the corpus through `guest-ct/src/plan.rs` (the rkyv row table, the
default-mode builder arm, the preparsed table) and `build.rs`'s corpus
list, give it a runner in `guest-ct/src/vectors.rs`, add the row's
`#[case_row]` registration in `guest-ct/src/lib.rs` — post-cutover rows
register there only; `plan::ROWS` is the frozen incumbent share — tag
the new cases with a feature name if any target legitimately cannot serve
them (declaring it missing in `driver-ct/targets.toml` for those targets,
and adding the feature's `!feature` decline case), and run
`just conformance-ct::lock-update` so the change lands as a reviewable
lockfile diff, then `just conformance-ct::matrix-update` from a full run
including the browser leg (without Chrome,
`just gha::update-matrices-from-ci` copies the matrices from the
branch's CI artifact). An algorithm of a kind with a contract battery
(`guest-ct/src/contract.rs`) also adds its table row there, inheriting the
kind's standard cases as `<interface>/contract/…` lockfile entries; only
behavior specific to the algorithm needs a hand-written probe. An algorithm
the in-guest provider deliberately does not export lives in the signing
suite — that is absence, not failure.

## Results-schema tolerance

The component-test *schema* tolerates unknown result statuses on the
wire (its additive-evolution policy: a future component-test status
arrives without a format break) and the aggregate reports them as
warnings; the incumbent runner treated unknown outcomes as hard
failures. This looked like a tolerance change, and for one revision of
this harness it was one for generated rows (#303 records the
correction). It is not one in effect: the fold diverts an
unknown-status row out of the parsed results, so the case is then
*missing* from coverage, and the aggregate's coverage check fails the
run — for the whole census. Exact `[[case]]` entries are set-checked
directly, and the `[[generated]]` rows' leaves are enumerated in the
lockfiles (`lock --leaves`, fed from `ct-driver --enumerate` by
`conformance-ct::lock-update`; polymorph-components/polymorph-test#49), so an
unenumerated or missing leaf is an error by name, not a warning. An
unknown status therefore surfaces as a warning naming the case and
status plus a coverage error, and cannot pass silently. Gating parity
with the incumbent holds; ratified on that basis (upstream's
fold/coverage tests pin the diversion and the leaf set-equality).

Two adjacent validation-semantics deltas vs the incumbent runner are
accepted, recorded here (the incumbent had no equivalents; #310 is the
analysis):

- **`deselected` is a green non-executed status.** A known schema
  status (a filtered run's complement), it counts as covered and is
  not failing, so a results file from a filtered run aggregates
  without error provided every case is present-or-deselected. The
  committed matrices are the backstop: per-row counts move when
  execution is displaced by deselection, and `matrix-check` diffs
  them in CI — a filtered results file cannot land without a visible
  matrix diff. No gating recipe passes a filter.
- **A `--missing` typo in a run recipe is caught behaviorally, not by
  a named declaration.** The envelope carries no declared-missing
  field to compare with targets.toml; instead the aggregate
  cross-checks every reported status against the manifest-derived
  applicability, so a recipe/manifest skew surfaces as per-case
  validation errors (executed-but-inapplicable, or
  applicable-but-not-applicable) rather than one declaration-mismatch
  error. Equally hard-failing, differently named.
