# `polymorph:webcrypto`

A WebCrypto-flavored WIT package plus multiple implementations that run the
*same* guest component: a Wasmtime host backed by RustCrypto, two JS hosts
backed by the platform's Web Crypto API — [deltic](https://github.com/lann/deltic)
(runtime-linked on stock Deno and in the browser; the primary JS path) and
jco (transpile-based) — and an in-guest wasm component
(RustCrypto compiled to wasm, composable via `wac plug`). A sibling of
[`polymorph:webrtc-datachannels`](https://github.com/polymorph-components/polymorph-webrtc-datachannels),
following the same architecture.

## Design

The package ([`wit/`](wit/), documented in
[`wit/README.md`](wit/README.md)) is layered by *primitive kind*, not by
algorithm:

- **Generic primitive interfaces** (`mac`, `aead`,
  `digest`, `signature`, `derivation`, …) each own the
  algorithm-agnostic resources. Adding an algorithm never touches them.
- **Algorithm interfaces** (`hmac-sha2`, `aes-gcm`, `sha2`,
  `ed25519-verify`/`-sign`, …) contain only
  *key minting* (`import-*`/`generate-*`). Everything else hangs off the key
  resource, so a key can never be used with the wrong algorithm. Signature
  minting splits the public and private halves into separate interfaces, so
  a provider can serve verification for an algorithm whose signing it
  declines to host. A signing key cannot yield its public half — the public
  key comes from `generate-key`, which returns the pair, or from
  `import-verifying-key` — so keys a provider can only *use* (an unspecified
  platform import path, a keystore-resident non-extractable key) remain
  representable.
- **Keys are resources — capabilities.** A world importing only `mac` can use
  key handles it is granted but cannot mint keys; only a world importing
  `hmac` can. `extractable: false` keys refuse `export-key`; on the JS hosts
  that flag is the platform `CryptoKey`'s own, so the platform enforces it.
  Every gated key resource also reports its `extractable` flag as a getter, so
  a holder can ask the question without taking the answer — and because a key
  resource need not have been minted by the component holding it. Export is
  fallible even where no gate applies: a provider may hold a key as a handle
  it can *use* but not *read*.
- **Byte `stream`s are the only bulk data path** (no buffer-taking `update`
  functions), so implementations have exactly one ingestion path and results
  are chunking-invariant. On Wasmtime the host consumes bytes directly from
  guest memory (`StreamConsumer`); between composed components a stream write
  is a direct memory-to-memory copy.
- **`aead` is honest about being a single-message primitive**: `open` resolves
  only after the whole ciphertext is drained and verified — `ok(stream)` *is*
  the authentication statement, and unverified plaintext is never observable.
  The returned stream still lets plaintext live outside the caller's linear
  memory (the practical ceiling moves from wasm32's 4 GiB to host RAM).
  Content beyond that contract is out of scope; `open` is never relaxed to
  stream unverified plaintext.
- **Operations are one-shot calls on immutable keys** (`sign`/`verify`,
  `seal`/`open`): there is no stateful computation object to misuse, so the
  `error` variant carries no misuse cases — incrementality comes from the
  streams, not from resource state.
- **`crypto.subtle` fidelity is measured, not assumed.** The
  `webcrypto-componentize` library re-exposes the package as `crypto.subtle`, and
  the vendored WebCryptoAPI web-platform-tests run through it in CI —
  WPT → shim → WIT → implementation — so the platform's own test suite
  meters what the interface shape preserves. Any deviation the shape forced
  would be a recorded ruling, not an accident (the set is currently empty);
  see AGENTS.md, "WPT fidelity is a first-class design constraint".

Current algorithms: **SHA-2** digests, **HMAC** (SHA-2 and SHA-1),
**AES-GCM**, **AES-CBC** and **AES-CTR**, **AES-KW** key wrapping,
**HKDF** and **PBKDF2** (minting `derive-input`s the key-minting
interfaces consume), **X25519** and **ECDH** key agreement, **Ed25519**,
**ECDSA** (P-256 and P-384, each with SHA-256/384/512),
**RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5** and **RSA-PSS**, and **RSA-OAEP**. Three surfaces
are gated `@unstable` (see [`wit/README.md`](wit/README.md), "Stability
gates"): the collision-detecting `sha1-checked` digest, RSA signing
(`rsa-sign`), and RSA-OAEP decryption (`rsa-oaep-decrypt`). The in-guest
provider withholds the timing-unsafe operations — ECDSA and RSA signing,
both RSA-OAEP halves — while signature *verification* is served
everywhere (see rust/guest-provider/README.md). The
AEAD wire format is `ciphertext ‖ tag` (`crypto.subtle`'s, which
RustCrypto produces identically). The variant enums also declare cases no
implementation here serves (`aes192`, the truncated SHA-2 variants) — each
algorithm's spec closes its set — which fail `unsupported`; a composition
needing one must supply its own provider. The exact per-interface contracts
and the package-wide ones (streaming, key options, errors, extractability)
are specified in [`wit/README.md`](wit/README.md) and the WIT doc comments.

Components that name the package in their own WIT pull it in through
`wit/deps/polymorph-webcrypto` symlinks back to the root `wit/`, so there is a
single copy to edit; guests built on `polymorph-webcrypto-guest` reach it through that
crate's bindings instead.

## Build & run

Prerequisites: Rust (via rustup; the toolchain and wasm target are pinned in
`rust-toolchain.toml`), `wasm-tools`, Deno 2.x (the deltic host — the
primary JS path; stock, no flags), and — for the jco host — Node 24+
(jco's async ABI uses JSPI). `./scripts/setup.sh` installs the rest. The
[polymorph-components/polymorph-test](https://github.com/polymorph-components/polymorph-test) test stack is
an ordinary git dependency pinned by rev in the root `Cargo.toml`
(enforced by `Cargo.lock`); cargo fetches it — no sibling checkout needed.

```sh
just test                    # Rust tests, incl. the guest-under-Wasmtime integration test
just demo::wasmtime          # run the guest under the Wasmtime (RustCrypto) host
just conformance-ct::run-deltic  # the conformance suites under the deltic host

just demo::test-composed     # compose guest + in-guest provider + driver (wac plug)

                             #   published runner component (no componentize-js
                             #   toolchain needed — see js/componentize/wpt/)
just componentize::test      # the composed pipeline with the JS demo guest
                             #   (needs the componentize-js CLI — see

                             #   see conformance/driver-ct/compat/)
just conformance-ct::web     # serve the conformance results viewer + a live
                             #   in-browser run of the suites (last local
                             #   run's results; the Pages site publishes the
                             #   same viewer with CI's results) — the support
                             #   matrix page is at conformance/driver-ct/compat/
just timing-lab::run         # dudect-style timing tests of the composed in-guest
                             #   provider (statistical; not part of `just ci`)
just ci                      # everything CI runs
```

All implementations run identical suite components. The conformance
tests (the vendored Wycheproof/CAVP/speccheck vectors — see
[`conformance/vectors/README.md`](conformance/vectors/README.md) — under
multiple stream-chunking schedules, plus API-contract probes) gate the
wasmtime-rustcrypto, deltic-deno, and jco-node targets everywhere (the
browser targets gate in CI); the `crypto-demo` guest additionally covers
the jco host end to end.

A note on the in-guest provider: wasm offers no portable constant-time
guarantees, so [`rust/guest-provider/README.md`](rust/guest-provider/README.md) classifies
algorithms by how exploitable their timing channels are in wasm (classes A–D)
and enforces the policy structurally — class D algorithms (e.g. RSA
private-key ops) are simply never exported by it, so compositions that need
them fail at `wac plug` time instead of running quietly degraded.

## Findings

- **jco component-model-async guest-heap corruption.** Running the full
  shared conformance suite in one instance under jco (JSPI, Node 24) corrupts the
  guest's heap — surfacing as `memory access out of bounds` in dlmalloc
  during async event delivery — while the *identical* guest binary runs the
  full suite clean under Wasmtime, both natively and fully composed. The
  trigger involves many drain-input-then-reject stream operations followed
  by async imports returning `result<list<u8>>`; failure is deterministic
  per case window but layout-dependent (a superset window can pass while
  its subset fails), i.e. the corruption is planted silently and detonates
  elsewhere. Diagnosed here, fixed upstream (jco #1768, released in 1.26.0);
  the jco-node conformance target gates again since the fix.
- **Streams-only interfaces make delivery schedules part of the contract.**
  Running every vector under multiple chunking schedules (whole / 1-byte /
  block-straddling) tests a claim a buffer-based API could
  never even express — and precisely this suite shape is what surfaced the
  runtime bug above.
