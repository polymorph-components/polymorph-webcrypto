//! Guest-side bindings and ergonomic helpers for the `polymorph:webcrypto`
//! interfaces.
//!
//! This crate is the intended way for Rust guest components to *consume*
//! `polymorph:webcrypto`: it binds the whole import surface once (the
//! [`bindings`] module) and wraps the key resources in newtypes whose
//! operations take a [`DataSource`] — a byte slice, an owned buffer, or a
//! component-model stream — so callers need none of the stream plumbing the
//! interfaces are defined in terms of.
//!
//! Most consumers need **no `polymorph:webcrypto` WIT at all**: link this crate
//! and call it, and the componentized binary imports exactly the interfaces
//! it uses (unused imports are stripped). Only list the imports in your own
//! world — remapping them onto this crate's [`bindings`] modules with
//! wit-bindgen's `with:` option — if your own interfaces name these types or
//! external tooling validates your world's shape. Do **not** bind the same
//! interfaces with a second `generate!` without that remapping: the two
//! expansions would produce distinct, unconvertible resource types, and the
//! newtypes here wrap only this crate's generation.
//!
//! # Cargo features
//!
//! - `bytes`: `DataSource::from_buf` feeds an operation from any
//!   `bytes::Buf`, chunk by chunk.
//! - `futures-io`: `DataSource::from_reader` feeds an operation from any
//!   `futures_io::AsyncRead`; read failures surface as [`Error::Read`].
//!
//! # Contract notes carried over from the WIT
//!
//! - **The wrappers hide streams, not the closure rule.** An operation's
//!   input stream ends no later than the operation completes, and only a
//!   failing operation may end it early; these helpers feed the source and
//!   await the result concurrently, reporting the operation's error over
//!   the feed's fate, so that contract is invisible here. Callers with
//!   needs beyond [`DataSource`] use the
//!   [`bindings`] resources directly with wit-bindgen's own stream
//!   primitives ([`wit_stream::new`], `StreamWriter::write_all`,
//!   [`StreamReader::collect`]).
//! - **Writer drop ends the message.** A stream's producer failing midway
//!   is indistinguishable from it finishing (the ABI carries no verdict at
//!   end-of-stream). Buffer-backed [`DataSource`]s own their whole input, so
//!   this only concerns stream-backed sources; see
//!   [`DataSource`]'s truncating-producer warning.
//! - **Implementations may bound input sizes.** Hosts enforce buffering
//!   limits as recoverable [`Error::Other`] values (see the WIT
//!   `types.error` docs); nothing here retries or special-cases them.
//! - **Nonces are the caller's problem on `aead`.** [`Aead::seal`] leaves
//!   nonce uniqueness per key entirely to you, and nonce reuse under one
//!   key defeats the algorithm's guarantees.
