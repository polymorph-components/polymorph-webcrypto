# Install the toolchain and dependencies needed to build, run, and test this
# repository. Safe to run repeatedly (idempotent).
#
# What it installs:
#   - the pinned Rust toolchain and the wasm targets the guest crates
#     compile to, as declared in rust-toolchain.toml
#   - wasm-tools, used to wrap guest modules into components and validate WIT
#   - just, the command runner used for development and CI recipes
#   - wac, the component linker used to compose the crypto-demo guest with the
#     in-guest provider (`just demo::compose`)
#   - wasmtime, the host runtime that runs the composed in-guest crypto
#     integration test (`just demo::test-composed`)
#   - the npm dependencies of every JS tree in the repository (jco host,
#     demos, conformance jco runner, webcrypto-componentize and its parity harness)
#
# Prerequisites (not installed here): a Rust toolchain via rustup, and — for
# the jco host — Node 24+ with npm (jco's async ABI uses JSPI, which Node
# exposes behind --experimental-wasm-jspi from 24 on).
#
# Environment overrides:
#   WASM_TOOLS_VERSION   version of wasm-tools to install (default below)
#   JUST_VERSION         version of just to install (default below)
#   SKIP_NODE=1          skip installing the npm dependencies
